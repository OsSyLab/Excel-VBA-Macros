*Combine Excel Files into Separate Sheets (Excel VBA)

This VBA macro imports multiple Excel files from a selected folder  
and merges them into a **single workbook**, creating a **separate worksheet** for each file  
while keeping all **original formatting, fonts, and column widths** intact.



**Features

*Imports each Excel file as a new sheet  
*Preserves formatting, colors, borders, and fonts  
*Automatically renames sheets based on file names  
* Supports both `.xlsx` and `.xlsm` files  
*Ideal for report consolidation or dashboard inputs

2. Click the **Combine Excel Files into One Workbook** button.  
3. Choose a folder containing Excel files.  
4. The macro creates one workbook with multiple sheets — one per file.
