# 🎨 Conditional Formatting Macro

**Excel VBA Macro #2 – Dynamic Highlighting Tool**

This macro automatically applies **custom conditional color formatting** to highlight important data based on user-defined rules or thresholds.  
It helps visualize key metrics instantly without using Excel's built-in conditional formatting menus.
