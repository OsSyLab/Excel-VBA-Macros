# 🔢 Convert Formulas to Values

**Excel VBA Macro #7 – Simplify Your Sheets by Converting Formulas to Static Values**

This macro converts selected cells (or entire ranges) containing formulas into **static values** — instantly freezing the results.  
It’s ideal for reducing file size, preventing accidental recalculations, and preserving report snapshots.
