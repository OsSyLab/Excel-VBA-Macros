# Excel Exact Match Highlight Macro

### Overview
This VBA macro automatically highlights all cells in your worksheet that **exactly match** the value typed in **cell B1**.  
It instantly clears previous highlights and applies a soft yellow color to every cell containing the same text or number.  
Perfect for quick lookups, reports, or quality control in large data sheets.

### Features
- Detects **exact matches only** (case-insensitive)
- Highlights only the matching **cells**, not entire rows
- Automatically clears previous colors before applying new highlights
- Fully automatic — **no button required**
- Lightweight and easy to customize

---

### How It Works
1. Type any keyword or number in **cell B1**.  
2. The macro scans the defined range (default: `A3:E50`) or the entire worksheet.  
3. Any cell whose value exactly equals your input is highlighted in **light yellow**.  
4. Delete the value in **B1** to remove all highlights.

### Example
If you type `Finance` in **B1**,  
only the cells that contain exactly `Finance` will be highlighted.  
Cells like `Finance Department` or `Financial Report` will **not** be affected.

### VBA Code Snippet

Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)
    Dim SearchCell As Range
    Dim DataRange As Range
    Dim c As Range
    Dim SearchText As String
    
    Set SearchCell = Me.Range("B1")
    If Intersect(Target, SearchCell) Is Nothing Then Exit Sub
    
    Set DataRange = Me.Range("A3:E50")
    DataRange.Interior.ColorIndex = xlNone
    
    SearchText = Trim(SearchCell.Value)
    If SearchText = "" Then Exit Sub
    
    For Each c In DataRange
        If StrComp(c.Text, SearchText, vbTextCompare) = 0 Then
            c.Interior.Color = RGB(255, 255, 153)
        End If
    Next c
End Sub

Setup
Open Excel and press ALT + F11 to open the VBA editor.

Go to your target worksheet (e.g., Sheet1).

Paste the code into the sheet module (not a standard module).

Adjust these two lines if needed:


Set SearchCell = Me.Range("B1")     ' Your search input cell
Set DataRange = Me.Range("A3:E50")  ' The data area to check
Demo
Cell	Description
B1	Search box (type any keyword)
A3:E50	Data range (scanned automatically)
Highlight Color	Light yellow (RGB 255,255,153)

Example: typing “Finance” in B1 will highlight only the cells that exactly equal “Finance”.
