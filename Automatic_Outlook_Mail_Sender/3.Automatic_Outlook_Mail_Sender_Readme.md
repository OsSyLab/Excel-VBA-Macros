# 📧 Excel Email Sender (Outlook Automation)

## Overview
This VBA macro allows users to automatically send personalized emails directly from Excel using **Microsoft Outlook**.  
Each row in your Excel sheet represents one email — containing the recipient address, subject, and message content.

Outlook must be installed on the same computer, and the signed-in Outlook profile will be used to send the emails.  
No passwords are stored, and no additional setup is required.

✅ Simple and clean sheet layout (Name, Email, Subject, Message)  
✅ Works with any version of Microsoft Outlook (Classic Desktop)

### Step 2: Modify the Sender Account
In the VBA code, you’ll find the following section:

```vb
For Each OutlookAccount In OutlookApp.Session.Accounts
    If LCase(OutlookAccount.SmtpAddress) = "your_email@example.com" Then
        senderFound = True
        Exit For
    End If
Next OutlookAccount

➡️ Replace "your_email@example.com" with the Outlook address you use on your computer.
Example:

If LCase(OutlookAccount.SmtpAddress) = "john.smith@outlook.com" Then


💡 This ensures the macro sends emails through your Outlook profile.

Step 3: Run the Macro

In Excel, press Alt + F8 to open the list of macros.
Choose SendMail and click Run.
Outlook will send the messages automatically using your specified account.
🧠 VBA Function Reference
Sub SendMail()

This procedure:

Opens Outlook via COM (no login prompt needed).
Reads each recipient row from the sheet named “MailList”.
Sends the email using the specified account.
Writes “Sent” in column E after successful delivery.

🧭 Notes

The sheet name must be “MailList” (case-insensitive).
Outlook (Classic Desktop version) must be installed.
Make sure Outlook is logged in with your account before running the macro.
The macro does not support New Outlook (Preview/PWA) versions yet.
Emails are sent instantly — if you prefer to preview before sending, use .Display instead of .Send.
