# 🧩 Excel & Python Integration

This demo project shows how to connect **Excel VBA** with **Python** to automate data processing.  
It exports data from Excel to a temporary CSV file, runs a Python script to process it,  
and then re-imports the results back into Excel with formatting preserved.

## 📁 Files Included

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Excel&Python_Integration.bas` | VBA module containing the macro |
| `Excel&Python_Integration_Demo.xlsm` | Demo Excel file with the “RUN PYTHON SCRIPT” button |
| `script.py` | Python script that processes the exported data |
| `Screenshot_1.png` | Before/After demonstration screenshot |

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Excel Data:**  
   The sheet contains only `Item` and `Amount` columns.

2. **Run the Macro:**  
   When you click the **RUN PYTHON SCRIPT** button:
   - Excel exports data to a temporary `.csv` file.  
   - The Python script is executed via command line.  
   - Processed results (Tax and Total columns) are imported back into Excel.  

3. **Result:**  
   The macro automatically aligns formatting (font, borders, color)  
   and displays a confirmation message once the operation is complete.

## 🧠 Important Notes

The VBA code uses **absolute file paths** for Python and the script location.  
Each user must **update these paths** according to their own system setup:


pyExe = "C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe"
pyScript = "C:\YourFolder\Excel_Python_Integration\script.py"
✅ Explanation:

pyExe → The full path to your local Python installation.
(e.g. C:\Users\John\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe)

pyScript → The full path to the Python script used for processing.
(e.g. C:\Projects\ExcelPythonIntegration\script.py)

If these paths are not correct, the macro will not be able to launch Python.

💡 Demo Overview
BEFORE START	AFTER PYTHON INTEGRATION
Excel only has “Item” and “Amount” columns.	Python adds “Tax” and “Total” columns for each record.
The button triggers export to CSV.	Results are imported back into Excel with same formatting.
Data is sent to Python for processing.	A success message confirms when the task completes.


🚀 How to Use
Open Excel&Python_Integration_Demo.xlsm.

Click the RUN PYTHON SCRIPT button.

Wait a few seconds while Python processes the data.

Check your Excel sheet — new “Tax” and “Total” columns will appear.

A confirmation message will appear when the integration is done.

🧩 Technologies Used
Excel VBA – for automation and data transfer

Python (pandas) – for data processing

CSV Bridge – as a lightweight interface between Excel and Python

🏁 Result
A fully automated integration between Excel and Python:
clean, reliable, and ready to extend for any advanced workflow.
Perfect for automating reporting, tax calculations, or data transformations.
